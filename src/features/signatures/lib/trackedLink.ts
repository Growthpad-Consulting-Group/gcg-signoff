/**
 * Builds a tracked-click URL for a signature template — clicking it hits
 * /api/templates/[id]/click, which logs the click (template, staff, label) then redirects to

 * mergeTags.ts) — same mechanism campaign banners already use for their own click tracking.

// Deliberately hardcoded, ignoring both NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL and window.location.origin — this
// URL gets baked permanently into stored template HTML the moment it's inserted, and that
// content ships to production regardless of which environment authored it. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
// is *correctly* localhost during local dev for other purposes (redirects, etc.), but using it
// here means editing locally silently bakes a dead localhost link into content real recipients
// will click. This one link always needs the real deployed URL, never "wherever this happens
// to be running right now". Exported so any other baked-in-at-save-time asset URL (self-hosted
// icon images, etc.) uses the same one instead of reinventing this with process.env — see
// blockSerializer.ts's SOCIAL_ICON/CONTACT_ICON, which used to get this wrong.
